# sht-editor: simple haskell text editor

A terrible text editor, intended to be a project to learn a little bit more Haskell. The application loosely follows the Elm architecture (probably a terrible choice for a *real* text editor).

## Instructions

Install GHC and Cabal, do `cabal run`. For development consider installing GHCup and HLS (language server for Haskell).
